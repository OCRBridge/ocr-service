## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please:

1. Read the [README.md](README.md) to understand the project
2. Check existing [issues](../../issues) and [pull requests](../../pulls) to avoid duplicates
3. Join our community discussions (if applicable)

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Tesseract OCR 5.3+
- Poppler utils (for PDF processing)
- libmagic (for file type detection)
- uv (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ocr-service.git
cd ocr-service

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ocr-service.git

# Install system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng poppler-utils libmagic1

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install base dependencies (Tesseract only - fastest)
uv sync --group dev

# OR install with EasyOCR support (if you need to test deep learning OCR)
uv sync --group dev --all-extras

# OR install specific extras
# uv pip install -e .[easyocr]  # EasyOCR only
# uv pip install -e .[ocrmac]   # macOS Vision framework (macOS only)
# uv pip install -e .[full]     # All OCR engines

# Create required directories
mkdir -p /tmp/uploads /tmp/results
chmod 700 /tmp/uploads /tmp/results

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
```

### Running the Development Server

**Option 1: Local Development** (fastest iteration)
```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Option 2: Docker Development** (matches production environment)
```bash
# Lite flavor (fastest Docker builds, Tesseract only)
docker compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.lite.yml up -d
# Or use: make docker-compose-lite-up

# Full flavor (includes EasyOCR, slower builds)
docker compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.yml up -d
# Or use: make docker-compose-full-up

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.lite.yml logs -f api

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.lite.yml up -d --build
```

**Building Docker Images Locally**:
```bash
# Build lite image (fast, ~2-3 min)
docker build --target lite -t ocr-service:lite .
# Or: make docker-build-lite

# Build full image (slow, ~10-15 min due to PyTorch)
docker build --target full -t ocr-service:full .
# Or: make docker-build-full

# Build both flavors
make docker-build-all
```

### Makefile Commands Reference

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile for common development tasks. Run `make help` to see all available commands.

### Key Directories

- **src/models/**: Define data models, request/response schemas, and domain objects
- **src/api/routes/**: Implement API endpoints
- **src/services/**: Implement business logic, OCR processing, and external integrations
- **tests/unit/**: Write unit tests with mocks/stubs for isolated testing
- **tests/integration/**: Write integration tests that use real services (Tesseract)

## Development Workflow

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. All contributions should adhere to this workflow:

### TDD Cycle

1. **Write a failing test first**
   - Write a test that describes the desired behavior
   - Run the test to verify it fails (Red)

2. **Implement minimal code to make the test pass**
   - Write just enough code to make the test pass
   - Run the test to verify it passes (Green)

3. **Refactor while keeping tests green**
   - Improve code quality, remove duplication
   - Ensure all tests still pass

4. **Repeat**
   - Continue with the next feature or bug fix

### Detailed TDD Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of change:

- `feature/add-pdf-support` - For new features
- `bugfix/fix-rate-limit-bypass` - For bug fixes
- `refactor/improve-error-handling` - For refactoring
- `docs/update-api-examples` - For documentation updates

### Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
<type>: <short summary>

<optional detailed description>

<optional footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat: add support for TIFF multi-page documents

Implemented TIFF processing using PIL to extract and process
multiple pages from TIFF files. Each page is converted to JPEG
before OCR processing.

Closes #123
```

## Testing

Testing is a critical part of our development process. All contributions must include appropriate tests. We follow a comprehensive testing strategy with **296 tests** covering unit, integration, and E2E scenarios.

> **Quick Command Reference**: For a quick reference of all development commands (testing, formatting, type checking, Docker, etc.), see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### Test Suite Overview

Our test suite consists of three types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`) - Fast, isolated tests with mocks
   - 127 tests covering validators, config, security, HOCR, registry
   - ~87% pass rate, targeting 90%+ coverage
   - Uses mock OCR engines for speed

2. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`) - Real I/O, FastAPI client
   - 111 tests covering API endpoints, health checks, file handling
   - ~87% pass rate, targeting 80%+ coverage
   - Uses TestClient for API testing

3. **E2E Tests** (`tests/e2e/`) - Real OCR engines
   - 40 tests with actual Tesseract and EasyOCR
   - 100% pass rate for Tesseract E2E
   - Marked with `@pytest.mark.easyocr` for CI flexibility

### Coverage Requirements

- **Overall**: Targeting 80-90% code coverage
- **Unit tests**: 90%+ for critical paths
- **Integration tests**: 80%+ for API endpoints
- **Current coverage**: 89%+
- New code should maintain or improve existing coverage

### Writing Tests

#### Unit Tests with Mock Engines

Unit tests should be fast, isolated, and use mock OCR engines:

```python
# tests/unit/test_validators.py
import pytest
from src.utils.validators import validate_file_format

def test_validate_jpeg_format():
    """Test JPEG format validation with magic bytes."""
    # Valid JPEG magic bytes
    jpeg_bytes = b"\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x00\x10JFIF"

    # Should not raise exception
    validate_file_format(jpeg_bytes, "image.jpg")
```

#### Integration Tests with TestClient

Integration tests use FastAPI's TestClient and mock engines:

```python
# tests/integration/api/test_ocr_endpoints.py
def test_process_document_success_tesseract(client, sample_jpeg_bytes):
    """Test successful document processing with tesseract."""
    files = {"file": ("test.jpg", io.BytesIO(sample_jpeg_bytes), "image/jpeg")}
    data = {"engine": "tesseract"}

    response = client.post("/v2/ocr/process", files=files, data=data)

    assert response.status_code == 200
    result = response.json()
    assert result["engine"] == "tesseract"
    assert result["hocr"].startswith("<?xml")
```

#### E2E Tests with Real Engines

E2E tests use actual OCR engines and PIL-generated test images:

```python
# tests/e2e/test_ocr_tesseract.py
import pytest

# Skip if Tesseract not installed
pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(
    not TESSERACT_AVAILABLE, reason="Tesseract engine not installed"
)

def test_tesseract_detects_text(tesseract_engine, test_image_simple_text):
    """Test that Tesseract actually detects text from image."""
    result = tesseract_engine.process(test_image_simple_text)

    # Should contain the word "TESTING"
    result_lower = result.lower()
    assert "test" in result_lower or "testing" in result_lower
```

### Test Fixtures

We provide comprehensive fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`:

**Mock Fixtures:**
- `mock_engine_registry` - Registry with mock Tesseract/EasyOCR
- `mock_tesseract_engine` - Individual mock engine instance
- `app` - FastAPI app with mock engine registry injected
- `client` - TestClient with mocked engines

**File Fixtures:**
- `sample_jpeg_bytes` - Valid JPEG magic bytes
- `sample_png_bytes` - Valid PNG magic bytes
- `sample_pdf_bytes` - Valid PDF magic bytes
- `test_image_with_text` - PIL-generated image with multi-line text
- `test_image_simple_text` - PIL-generated image with "TESTING"
- `test_image_multiline` - PIL-generated image with 3 lines

**HOCR Fixtures:**
- `sample_hocr` - Valid HOCR XML with proper DOCTYPE
- `sample_hocr_multipage` - Multi-page HOCR document
- `sample_easyocr_output` - Raw EasyOCR detection output

### Test Markers

Use pytest markers to categorize tests:

```python
# Mark EasyOCR tests (deep learning)
@pytest.mark.easyocr
def test_easyocr_processing():
    ...

# Mark Tesseract tests
@pytest.mark.tesseract
def test_tesseract_processing():
    ...

# Mark Ocrmac tests
@pytest.mark.ocrmac
def test_ocrmac_processing():
    ...

# Skip if dependency not available
@pytest.mark.skipif(not TESSERACT_AVAILABLE, reason="Tesseract not installed")
def test_tesseract_processing():
    ...
```

### Test Organization Best Practices

- **One assertion concept per test** - Test one thing at a time
- **Descriptive names** - `test_validate_jpeg_with_valid_magic_bytes()`
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** - Clear structure in every test
- **Use fixtures** - Avoid code duplication
- **Fast by default** - Unit tests should run in milliseconds
- **Mock external dependencies** - Keep tests isolated
- **Test error paths** - Don't just test happy paths

### CI/CD Testing

Our GitHub Actions workflow runs tests automatically:

- **Fast Tests Job**: Unit + Integration tests (~5 min)
  - Runs on every push and PR
  - Includes linting, formatting, type checking
  - Uploads coverage to Codecov

- **E2E Tests Job**: Tesseract E2E tests (~2 min)
  - Validates real OCR functionality
  - Runs on every push and PR

- **Slow Tests Job**: EasyOCR E2E tests (~30 min)
  - Runs only on main branch or manual trigger
  - Deep learning model initialization is slow

- **Coverage Report Job**: Generates HTML coverage report
  - Uploads as GitHub artifact
  - 30-day retention

## Code Quality

We maintain high code quality standards using automated tools.

### Code Formatting

We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format src/ tests/

# Check linting
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff check --fix src/ tests/
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write docstrings for public functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

class JobStatus(BaseModel):
    """Represents the status of an OCR job.

    Attributes:
        job_id: Unique identifier for the job
        status: Current status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
        upload_time: ISO timestamp of upload
        error_message: Error details if status is failed
    """
    job_id: str
    status: str
    upload_time: str
    error_message: Optional[str] = None

    def is_complete(self) -> bool:
        """Check if the job has finished processing.

        Returns:
            True if status is completed or failed, False otherwise
        """
        return self.status in ("completed", "failed")
```

### Type Checking

This project uses [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty) for static type checking. All code should include type hints:

```bash
# Run type checker
uv run ty check

# Check specific directory
uv run ty check src/
```

**Note**: Type checking is automatically run via pre-commit hooks. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for pre-commit hook configuration and commands.

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes following TDD**
   - Write tests first
   - Implement the feature
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Run code formatters

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Go to the original repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Fill out the PR template

### CI/CD Build Strategy

Understanding our CI/CD workflow helps you know what to expect when submitting PRs:

**Automatic Builds on Your PR**:
- ✅ **Lite flavor**: Builds automatically on every PR (~2-3 min)
  - Validates core functionality with Tesseract OCR
  - Fast feedback for most code changes
- ⏭️ **Full flavor**: Skipped on PRs to save CI resources
  - Large PyTorch/EasyOCR dependencies (~10-15 min build)
  - Not needed for most PRs

**When Full Flavor Builds Run**:
- 🏷️ **Release tags** (`v*.*.*`) - Automatic on version releases
- 🔀 **Main branch** pushes - Automatic after PR merge
- 🖱️ **Manual dispatch** - Maintainers can trigger via GitHub Actions UI

**Why This Strategy?**
- Faster PR feedback (3 min vs 15 min)
- Reduced CI costs and resource usage
- Most code changes don't require GPU dependencies
- Full validation happens before releases

**For Maintainers**: To manually build the full flavor for a specific PR:
1. Go to Actions → Docker Image CI → Run workflow
2. Select the PR branch
3. Check "Build full flavor"
4. Run workflow

**What This Means for Contributors**:
- Your PR will show a passing check if lite builds successfully
- If your changes specifically affect EasyOCR functionality, mention it in the PR
- Maintainers may trigger a full build if needed
- All flavors are validated before merging to main

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`uv run ruff format`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`uv run ruff check`)
- [ ] Coverage is maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if needed)
- [ ] Commit messages follow guidelines
- [ ] PR description clearly explains the changes
- [ ] Related issues are referenced

### PR Review Process

1. **Automated checks will run**:
   - Lite Docker image build (~2-3 min)
   - Tests, linting, and coverage checks
2. **Maintainers will review your code**
3. **Address any feedback or requested changes**
4. **Once approved, your PR will be merged**
   - Full flavor build will run automatically on main branch
   - All flavors validated before release tags

## Platform Limitations

### macOS-specific Dependencies

The `ocrmac` package provides access to Apple's Vision and LiveText OCR frameworks but has important limitations:

- **Docker Incompatibility**: ocrmac requires macOS-native frameworks that are unavailable in Docker containers (even on Mac hosts)
- **Local Development**: Works only when running the application natively on macOS
- **Alternative Engines**: Tesseract and EasyOCR work in all environments including Docker

For detailed platform requirements and limitations, see the [Platform Limitations section in AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#platform-limitations).
